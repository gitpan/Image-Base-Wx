=head1 NAME

Image::Base::Wx::DC -- draw into a Wx::DC

=for test_synopsis my $dc

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Image::Base::Wx::DC;
 my $image = Image::Base::Wx::DC->new
                 (-dc => $dc);
 $image->line (0,0, 99,99, '#FF00FF');
 $image->rectangle (10,10, 20,15, 'white');

=head1 CLASS HIERARCHY

C<Image::Base::Wx::DC> is a subclass of C<Image::Base>,

    Image::Base
      Image::Base::Wx::DC

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Image::Base::Wx::DC> extends C<Image::Base> to draw into a
C<Wx::DC>.

Native C<Wx::DC> does much more than C<Image::Base> but if you have some
generic pixel twiddling code for C<Image::Base> then this class can point it
at Wx for a window or printer paint, etc.

See C<Image::Base::Wx::Bitmap> for a subclass drawing into C<Wx::Bitmap>
with file loading and saving too.

=head2 Colour Names

Colour names are anything recognised by C<< Wx::Colour->new() >>, which as
per its C<Set()> method means

    "pink"            names per wxColourDatabase
    "#RRGGBB"         2 digit hex
    "RGB(r,g,b)"      decimal 0 to 255

1,3 or 4 digit hex might work too, but might be platform dependent.

The colour is applied to the "pen" in the C<-dc>, and for filling to the
"brush" too.  The pen is also set to C<wxCAP_PROJECTING> to ensure the last
pixel is drawn for C<line()>.  That might be an artifact of the X11 "on the
boundary above or left" rule, but in any case gets the right effect.

If the colour etc in the C<-dc> is changed elsewhere then what
C<Image::Base::Wx::DC> thinks it has set will be invalid.  Set C<-dc> into
the C<$image> again to reset.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Image::Base/FUNCTIONS> for the behaviour common to all Image-Base
classes.

=over 4

=item C<$image = Image::Base::Wx::DC-E<gt>new (key=E<gt>value,...)>

Create and return a new image object.  A C<-dc> parameter must be
given,

    $image = Image::Base::Wx::DC->new
                 (-dc => $dc);

Further parameters are applied per C<set> (see L</ATTRIBUTES> below).

=item C<$image-E<gt>xy ($x, $y, $colour)>

Get or set the pixel at C<$x>,C<$y>.

Getting a pixel is per C<Wx::DC> C<GetPixel()>.  In the current code colours
are returned in "#RRGGBB" form (C<wxC2S_HTML_SYNTAX> of C<Wx::Colour>).

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item C<-dc> (C<Wx::DC> object)

The target dc.

=item C<-width>, C<-height> (read-only)

The size of the DC's target, as per C<$dc-E<gt>GetSize()>.

=back
